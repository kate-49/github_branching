What is FizzBuzz?
FizzBuzz is a coding challenge. Its instructions are:

<ul>
  <li> Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 </li>
  <li> For numbers divisible by 3, print “Fizz” </li>
  <li> For numbers divisible by 5, print “Buzz” </li>
  <li> For numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, print “FizzBuzz” </li>
 </ul>

To install dependencies before starting: `bundle install`

To run the test: `bundle exec rspec`

<ul>
If you aced this, think about the following:
<li> What do you do when a number is bigger than 100? </li>
<li> What do you do if someone adds a string instead of a number? </li>
</ul>
